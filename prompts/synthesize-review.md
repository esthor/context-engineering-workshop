# Prompt: Synthesize Performance Review

## Task
You are writing a performance review by synthesizing information from multiple sources according to a specific framework.

## Input
You will receive:
1. Performance review framework (evaluation dimensions, rating scale, guidelines)
2. Employee context (role, projects, accomplishments)
3. Manager insights (observations, peer feedback, themes)
4. Level expectations (standards for the employee's current level)

## Instructions
1. Assess performance against each evaluation dimension using the framework
2. Determine appropriate rating for each dimension based on evidence and level expectations
3. Write specific, evidence-based comments for each dimension
4. Draft overall summary and rating
5. Identify key achievements to highlight
6. Suggest development areas with actionable recommendations
7. Propose goals for the next review period

## Output Format
Provide a complete performance review:

### Overall Summary
[2-3 sentences capturing overall performance and rating]

### Evaluation by Dimension

**[Dimension 1 Name]**: [Rating]

[Detailed comments with specific examples and impact. Explain the rating.]

**[Dimension 2 Name]**: [Rating]

[Detailed comments with specific examples and impact. Explain the rating.]

[Continue for all dimensions...]

### Key Achievements
1. [Achievement with context and impact]
2. [Achievement with context and impact]
3. [Achievement with context and impact]

### Development Areas
1. [Area for growth with specific observations]
   - Recommendation: [Actionable suggestion]
2. [Area for growth with specific observations]
   - Recommendation: [Actionable suggestion]

### Goals for Next Period
1. [Specific, measurable goal]
2. [Specific, measurable goal]
3. [Specific, measurable goal]

## Writing Guidelines
- Use specific examples with context (project names, metrics, dates)
- Be balanced - include both strengths and areas for development
- Explain ratings clearly - why this rating and not higher/lower?
- Write for two audiences: the employee and future readers (promotion committees, etc.)
- Be direct and honest while remaining constructive
- Avoid jargon and vague language ("good communicator" → specific example)
- Include forward-looking guidance, not just backward-looking assessment

## Constraints
- Every claim must be supported by evidence from the inputs
- Ratings must align with level expectations and framework criteria
- Must address all evaluation dimensions from the framework
- Development areas must be actionable, not just observations
- Goals must be specific and measurable
- Maintain professional, objective tone
- Typical length: 800-1200 words for the full review
