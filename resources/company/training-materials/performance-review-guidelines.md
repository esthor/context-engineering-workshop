# Performance Review Guidelines

## Overview

This document outlines TechCorp's performance review framework for software engineers. All managers should use these guidelines when conducting annual and mid-year performance reviews.

## Evaluation Dimensions

### 1. Technical Excellence

Engineers are evaluated on their ability to write clean, maintainable code and make sound technical decisions.

**Key Criteria:**
- Code quality and adherence to best practices
- System design and architectural contributions
- Technical problem-solving ability
- Understanding of relevant technologies and frameworks

### 2. Impact & Delivery

Engineers should consistently deliver high-quality work that moves the business forward.

**Key Criteria:**
- Completion of assigned projects and tasks
- Quality of deliverables
- Ability to meet deadlines
- Measurable impact on product metrics or team efficiency

### 3. Collaboration & Communication

Strong collaboration skills are essential for team success.

**Key Criteria:**
- Code review participation and quality of feedback
- Documentation quality
- Cross-team collaboration
- Mentoring and knowledge sharing
- Communication clarity in written and verbal formats

### 4. Growth & Learning

Engineers should demonstrate continuous learning and adaptation to new challenges.

**Key Criteria:**
- Adoption of new technologies and practices
- Seeking feedback and acting on it
- Taking on stretch assignments
- Contributing to team/company learning initiatives

## Rating Scale

Performance is rated on a three-point scale:

- **Doesn't Meet Expectations**: Performance falls short of role requirements. Requires immediate improvement plan.
- **Achieved / Meets Expectations**: Solid performance that meets all core requirements of the role. This is the expected standard.
- **Beyond Expectations**: Exceptional performance that significantly exceeds role requirements. Demonstrates consistent impact beyond core responsibilities.

## Writing Effective Reviews

### Be Specific
Use concrete examples with context. Instead of "good communicator," write "Led the API redesign discussion with clear documentation and diagrams, resulting in team alignment within one week."

### Be Balanced
Include both strengths and areas for development. Even high performers have growth opportunities.

### Be Forward-Looking
Include actionable recommendations for the next review period.

### Use Evidence
Reference specific projects, pull requests, design documents, or incidents. Include metrics where applicable.

## Review Components

Each review should include:

1. **Summary Statement**: 2-3 sentences capturing overall performance
2. **Dimension Ratings**: Rating and detailed comments for each of the 4 dimensions
3. **Key Achievements**: 3-5 specific accomplishments from the review period
4. **Development Areas**: 2-3 areas for growth with specific recommendations
5. **Goals for Next Period**: 3-4 clear, measurable objectives

## Timeline

- Reviews conducted twice annually (June and December)
- Managers receive reminder 4 weeks before deadline
- Draft reviews due 2 weeks before deadline for calibration
- Final reviews delivered to employees by deadline
- Follow-up 1:1 scheduled within one week of review delivery
