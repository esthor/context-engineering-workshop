# Peer Feedback - Sarah Chen (H2 2024)

## Feedback from Jamie Park (Junior Engineer, Payments Team)

**What has Sarah done well?**

"Sarah has been an incredible mentor to me. When I was struggling with async programming patterns, she took the time to pair with me and explain not just the 'how' but the 'why.' She's patient and never makes me feel dumb for asking questions. Her code reviews are detailed and educational - I learn something from every one. She also created really great documentation that the whole team uses."

**Areas for development:**

"Sometimes Sarah takes on too much and doesn't delegate. There were a few times I could have helped her but she said she'd handle it. I think she's protective of quality but could trust the team more."

**Rating**: Beyond Expectations

## Feedback from Marcus Johnson (Mid-Level Engineer, Payments Team)

**What has Sarah done well?**

"Sarah is the go-to person on our team for hard technical problems. During the multi-currency project, she designed an elegant solution to a really complex problem. Her technical design docs are thorough and well-thought-out. She also improved our on-call process significantly - the runbook automation and Slack bot have made my on-call weeks way less stressful."

**Areas for development:**

"I'd love to see Sarah present her work more widely. She does amazing stuff but doesn't always communicate it beyond our team. Leadership should know about the impact she's having."

**Rating**: Beyond Expectations

## Feedback from Lisa Wong (Product Manager, Payments)

**What has Sarah done well?**

"Working with Sarah on multi-currency was great. She asked really good questions about edge cases I hadn't considered, which saved us from potential customer issues. She's also gotten much better at explaining technical tradeoffs in business terms - at the start of the project it was harder, but by the end she was clearly communicating cost/benefit to stakeholders. Really appreciated her flexibility when requirements changed mid-project."

**Areas for development:**

"In the early phases, there was some friction around requirements clarity. Sarah wanted everything perfectly specified upfront, which isn't always realistic in product work. She adapted well, but could start projects with a bit more comfort with ambiguity."

**Rating**: Meets Expectations (trending toward Beyond)

## Feedback from David Kim (Staff Engineer, Fraud Team)

**What has Sarah done well?**

"Sarah's idempotency framework from the retry project is excellent engineering. We adopted it on the Fraud team and it's working great. She was generous with her time explaining the design choices and helping us adapt it. Her tech talk was one of the best internal presentations I've seen - clear, practical, with real examples. She's definitely operating at a senior level, maybe higher."

**Areas for development:**

"For Staff level, I'd like to see Sarah drive more strategic initiatives that span multiple teams. She has the technical chops, now it's about scope and influence. She should be shaping team roadmaps, not just executing on them."

**Rating**: Beyond Expectations (at Senior level, ready for next level with growth)

## Feedback from Tom Anderson (Engineering Manager, Checkout Team)

**What has Sarah done well?**

"Sarah helped us debug a critical production issue that was touching the payments system. Even though it wasn't her on-call shift, she jumped in and helped us find the root cause in the retry logic. She's also been responsive to our team's questions as we integrated with the new payment APIs. Great cross-team collaborator."

**Areas for development:**

"No major development areas from my perspective. Just keep doing what she's doing and maybe take on even more cross-team leadership."

**Rating**: Meets Expectations (limited interaction, but all positive)
