## First Principles

*USE GIT AND COMMIT EARLY AND OFTEN*

Raw (No intermediaries) no compaction -- 

Single-purpose agents and functions

3 months of hacking with llms can save you 5 mins of context engineering

Prepare everything first

Test/Verify early and often -- Play!

0% of context window is the best

SHIP!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! (your evals are good but they aren't reality) (...benchmarks are even worse)

The user is never wrong.
